**First impressions about the course**

*At first **overwhelming** for non experienced programmers or advanced users in the computer field. Nonetheless, after a few hours of careful reading instructions and self learning sessions in the provided tools one can start to understand that **sky is the limit** for the stubborn and motivated individuals.*
