*At first **overwhelming** for non experienced programmers or advanced users in the computer field. Nonetheless, after a few hours of careful reading instructions and self learning sessions in the provided tools one can start to understand that **sky is the limit** for the stubborn and motivated individuals.*

This course will allow you to master R language and give you insights in the possible ways you can use it.
