# Clustering and classification

*This chapter will teach you how one can cluster datasets. There is different methos to perform the clustering of the data, but in a very simple point of view you cluster what is similar. For that you can use different parameters, from means to specifically chosen parameters*

## **Work done during the week and learning summary.**

The data to be used in this exercise will be loaded from the library {MASS}. 

```{r}
# access the MASS package
library(MASS)

# load the data
data("Boston")
```

The Boston data set covers the infomration relative to Boston city crime, , nitrogen oxide concentrations , avergade rooms per dwelling, lower status of the population, pupil-teacher ratio in town, etc.. 

```{r}
str(Boston)
dim(Boston)
```

You can see that the data includes a total of 14 variables and 506 observations.
